## Page resources
##   Buttons can be generated in the page header to link to associated resources.
##   The example below shows how to create a Twitter link for a project and 
##   how to create a link to a post that was originally published on Medium:
links:
  - icon_pack: fab
    icon: twitter
    name: Follow
    url: 'https://twitter.com/Herb_hewang' # (required)
  # - icon_pack: fab
  #   icon: medium
  #   name: Originally published on Medium
  #   url: 'https://medium.com'   # (required)

## The following parameters can be added to the front matter of 
##   a page (such as a blog post) to control its features:
reading_time: true  # Show estimated reading time?
share: true  # Show social sharing links?
profile: true  # Show author profile?
commentable: false  # Allow visitors to comment? Supported by the Page, Post, and Docs content types.
editable: false  # Allow visitors to edit the page? Supported by the Page, Post, and Docs content types.    

## To enable LaTeX math rendering for a page, you should include `math: true` in the pageâ€™s front matter.
##   I have enabled math on the homepage or for all pages, by globally setting `math = true` in `config/_default/params`
math: false

## Enable a Markdown extension for diagrams by toggling the diagram 
##   option in your `config/_default/params.toml` file or 
##   by adding `diagram: true` to your page front matter.
diagram: true
